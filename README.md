## Enhanced Project Plan

### Project Overview
Develop a Go-based application that uses advanced computer vision and machine learning techniques to detect, segment, and identify objects in real-time video feeds, and send notifications to the user's devices when specific objects are detected.

### Key Features
- Capture video frames from a webcam or IP camera
- Utilize the Metta SAM 2 model for precise object segmentation
- Leverage the YOLO-World model for text and image-based object detection
- Allow the user to specify the target objects to be detected
- Send notifications to the user's devices (e.g., via D-Bus) when the target objects are detected
- Provide a visual display of the processed frames with bounding boxes and segmented objects

### Project Tasks

1. **Set up the development environment**
   - Install Go and the required dependencies (OpenCV, D-Bus, etc.)
   - Download and integrate the YOLOv8 ONNX model into the project

2. **Implement the core functionality**
   - Initialize the video capture device (webcam or IP camera)
   - Load the Metta SAM 2 and YOLO-World models
   - Continuously capture frames and detect/segment objects using the loaded models
   - Implement the logic to check for target objects and trigger notifications

3. **Notification system implementation**
   - Research and implement the D-Bus interface to send notifications to the user's devices
   - Ensure the notification system is reliable and customizable

4. **User experience and visualization**
   - Implement a visual display of the processed frames with bounding boxes and segmented objects
   - Explore ways to make the user interface more intuitive and informative (e.g., object labels, confidence scores)

5. **Testing and error handling**
   - Implement unit tests for the core functionality
   - Develop integration tests to ensure the overall system works as expected
   - Implement robust error handling and graceful error reporting

6. **Deployment and documentation**
   - Package the application for easy deployment (e.g., containerize with Docker)
   - Create detailed documentation, including installation instructions and user guide

7. **Refinement and future improvements**
   - Gather user feedback and identify areas for improvement
   - Explore additional features, such as support for multiple target objects, custom object detection models, or advanced notification settings
